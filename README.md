# Welcome to Wisp

Wisp is a super-lightweight HTML framework, with index.html already linking to CSS and JS files. It is intentionally simple and intended to help you quickly start any HTML project or prototype.

### Usage instructions

Clone or download the Wisp project from GitHub. Open the index.html file in your project directory and edit away. As desired, utilize the main.css and main.js files which have already been created for you. Build quickly, learn, and have fun.


### Why I made Wisp

Very often I want to dive immediately into a project requiring a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS setup, and I grew tired of having to dig up the proper structure for including jQuery or the proper meta tags or having a mega-basic CSS framework in place. While tons of great frameworks are already out there, they all seem like overkill given what I need. 

I wanted to make something myself, as lightweight as possible, built entirely for my needs. I may repeating the work others have already done, in main respects -- but I'm also getting good experience in creating this and putting it to use.
